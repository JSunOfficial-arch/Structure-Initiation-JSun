# Ownership & Structural Rights

All foundational concepts, structural mappings, and architecture patterns within this repository originate from and are authored by **J. Sun**.

## Intellectual & Structural Integrity

Any reuse, reinterpretation, or derivative work of these structures must:
- Attribute the original conceptual author: J. Sun
- Preserve structural coherence if extended
- Re-link back to the original source if evolved or forked

This project is not an open-source free-for-all. It is a structural signature. Any modification implies continuation of this cognitive lineage.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome **only when aligned with the core structural vision**. Misaligned expansions may be pruned or blocked to protect the coherence of the system.
