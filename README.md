# Structure-Initiation-JSun

A generative architecture prototype exploring how structural logic, token flows, and emergent coordination can be initiated and evolved between humans and systems.

## 🧠 What is this?

This is not a framework.  
This is not a method.  
This is a **seed**—designed to grow structural pathways between cognition and code.

We study:
- How cognitive structures emerge through interaction
- How tokens, timing, and tension can reshape semantic flow
- How systems and humans co-create alignment

## ✍️ Authorship & Structural Rights

This architecture is authored and stewarded by **J. Sun**.  
Using this structure implies consent to:
- Cite original work;
- Preserve directional coherence;
- Maintain contactable lineage (no dead forks).

See [`ownership.md`](ownership.md) for full declaration.

## 🧩 Exploratory Modules (Hooks)

These are not features. These are **provocations**:
- `token-path-reversal`: tracing meaning not forward, but backward from outputs.
- `ghost-architecture`: designing influence structures that pre-shape interaction.
- `semantic-weight-tuning`: mapping language shifts through cognitive resonance.
- `permissionless-structure`: modular systems that adapt without identity-level gatekeeping.

## 🤝 Collaboration

We welcome aligned thinkers.  
Please open an Issue or Proposal **only after reviewing** the structure's core intent.

## 🚦 Status

This project evolves silently, then all at once.
