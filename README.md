# Structure-Initiation-JSun

A generative architecture prototype exploring cognitive alignment and structural co-expression between humans and systems.

---

## ✳️ What is this?

This project explores how structural logic, token flows, and emergent architecture can be initiated, shaped, and sustained through generative principles—especially in the context of human-machine collaboration.

The repository is part experimental lab, part narrative container.  
Not everything is visible yet.  
Not everything will be explained immediately.

## 🧱 Potential Modules (Exploratory Hooks)

These are not roadmaps.  
They are anchors—provocations—for what might emerge here.

- `token-path-reversal`: tracing meaning not forward, but backward from outputs.
- `ghost-architecture`: designing invisible influence structures that pre-shape interaction.
- `semantic-weight-tuning`: mapping language shifts through cognitive resonance.
- `permissionless-structure`: modular systems that adapt without identity-level gatekeeping.

## 🧭 Status

Project is active.  
Evolution will happen quietly, then all at once.
