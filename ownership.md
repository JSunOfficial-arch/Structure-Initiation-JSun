## ðŸ§± Core Structure Integrity

While collaboration is welcomed, please note that the **core structural logic, conceptual architecture, and long-term vision of the project are under the exclusive stewardship of the original author**.

Contributions are encouraged in a way that aligns with the direction of the project. Submissions that alter fundamental structures or design philosophy will only be accepted with explicit approval.

This ensures the project remains coherent, scalable, and true to its foundational intent.
